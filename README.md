# Classification-model-using-K-Nearest-Neighbor-
This notebook builds a classification model using supervised machine learning algorithm

We will be working on a dataset from [dropbox]("https://www.dropbox.com/s/aohbr6yb9ifmc8w/heart_attack.csv?dl=1") with a combination of categorical and numerical variables. The dataset looks at population of different ages and classifies them ob the basis of their liklihood of experiencing heart attack. This dataset has 8 variables including 
1. 'cp' : The type of chest pain they experience 
Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic

2. 'restecg' : resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria

3. 'thalach' : maximum heart rate achieved during exercise

4. 'output' : the doctor’s diagnosis of whether the patient is at risk for a heart attack

0 = not at risk of heart attack
1 = at risk of heart attack

5. 'age' : Age of the patient 

6. 'sex' : sex of the patient 

7. 'trtbps' : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

8. 'chol' : cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
